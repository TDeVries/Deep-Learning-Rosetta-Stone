# Deep Learning Rosetta Stone

The goal of this project is to create a collection of deep learning model examples implemented using different libraries. For each architecture type we plan to provide matching implementations for each of the major deep learning libraries, including Keras, Tensorflow, and Pytorch.

### Supported Libraries
Currently we plan to include examples for the following libraries, although more may be added with time.
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Pytorch

#### TODO
Basically everything, considering the project just started:
* Logistic Regression
* MLP
* CNN
* RNN (LSTM)
* Autoencoders
* GAN
* Glossary of terms for each library
